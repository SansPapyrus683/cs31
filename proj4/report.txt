I had a slight bit of trouble coding divide, but then I realized that this wasn't ICPC and O(N^2) would probably still pass.

TEST CASES:
reduplicate:

locate:

locationOfMax:

circleLeft:

enumerateRuns:

flip:

locateDifference:

subsequence:

locateAny:

divide:

For all of these functions, passing a negative number as an array size parameter should result in a return value of -1.
