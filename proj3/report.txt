The only difficulty I had during this project was finding an elegent way of implementing plotLine() without having too much duplicate code. I ended up needing to have two for loops that do basically the same thing, but other than that the project was fairly easy.

The pseudocode for plotLine() is as follows:
if dir or fgbg invalid:
    return false
if start is out of bounds or plotChar isn't printable:
    return false

calculate end point
if end point is out of bounds:
    return false

for points between start and end pt:
    set the character at the point to be plotChar

performCommands() is a bit of a long one, but it works by keeping a pointer to the current character the program is at.
While there's still more characters to be read, it reads in the next command and executes the operations specified.
If the current command is a H or V command, it calls parseNum, a subroutine that reads in a number starting from the specified position.
parseNum() returns the ending position of the number and the value of the number.
If the value of the number is INT32_MIN, this means a syntax error has occured.
Besides that, the rest of the function is fairly straightforward.

TEST CASES:

All commands are on a grid size of 10x10.

For plotLine():
(2, 3, 5, HORIZ, 'a', FG) - standard test with valid input
(5, 5, 2, VERT, 'c', BG) - another standard test with valid input
(1, 1, 20, VERT, 'b', BG) - should return false as it plots OOB
(-1, -1, 6, HORIZ, 'c', FG) - should return false as the start is OOB
(2, 3, 5, HORIZ, '中', BG) - should return false as the character is invalid
(2, 3, 5, -1, 'a', FG) - should return false as dir parameter is invalid

For performCommands():
Only the command string is given as the rest are unnecessary.
H2F#V2 - standard test with valid input
H2H2H2F#CV2V2V2 - a longer standard test
H? - syntax error @ position 1
H8F#V20 - OOB error @ position 4
H234 - syntax error @ position 3
H6V4F中 - syntax error @ position 5
Any of the above tests with an invalid plotChar or mode should return 2 as the spec defines.
