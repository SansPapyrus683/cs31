<p>
You have arrived in the walled city of Tooton, whose residents, known as
Tooters, eat beans, cabbage, and hard-boiled eggs with every meal.  Although
they are used to the resulting effects, the odor that emanates from the
Tooters you encounter makes you woozy.  Your only hope to keep from passing
out is to successfully preach to the Tooters about converting to a diet of
lean meat, lettuce, and rice.
</p>
<p>
That's the scenario for a new video game under development.  Your
assignment is to complete the prototype that uses character-based graphics.
</p>
<p>
If you execute <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/toot.exe">this Windows program</a> or
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/tootmac.zip">this Mac program</a> or <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/toot.linux">this
Linux program</a>, you will see the player (indicated by <code>@</code>)
in a rectangular city filled with Tooters (usually indicated by
<code>T</code>).  At each turn, the user will select an action for the
player to take.  The player will take the action, and then each Tooter will
move one step in a random direction.  The attempt to move will make each
Tooter break wind.  If the Tooter is orthogonally adjacent to the player,
the player is affected by the blast of gas.  If the player suffers twelve such
blasts during the game, the player passes out and the game is over.
</p>
<p>
This smaller <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/minitoot.exe">Windows version</a> or
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/minitootmac.zip">Mac version</a> or
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/minitoot.linux">Linux version</a> of the game may help you see
the operation of the game more clearly.
</p>
<p>
At each turn the player may take one of these actions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Move one step up, down, left, or right to an empty position (i.e., one not
occupied by a Tooter).  If the player attempts to move into the wall of
the city (e.g., down, when on the bottom row) or to a position occupied by a
Tooter, the player does not move.
</li>
<li>
Preach to the Tooters adjacent to the player orthogonally or diagonally
(i.e.,Rto any Tooters next to the player in the eight directions).  Each of
those Tooters independently has a 2/3 probability of the player converting
that Tooter to no longer pollute the air.  A Tooter who has been converted
should be removed from the game, since it poses no further threat to the
player and is thus irrelevant.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The game allows the user to select the player's action by typing u/d/l/r for
moving or just hitting enter for preaching.  The user may also type q to
prematurely quit the game.
</p>
<p>
When it's the Tooters' turn, each Tooter picks a random direction (up,
down, left, or right) with equal probability.  The Tooter moves one step
in that direction if it can; however, if doing so would cause the Tooter
to move into a wall of the city (e.g., down, when on the bottom row) or to the
position occupied by the player, it does not move.  More than one Tooter
may occupy the same position; in that case, instead of <code>T</code>, the
display will show a digit character indicating the number of Tooters at
that position (where <code>9</code> indicates 9 or more).  After each
Tooter attempts to move (even if it doesn't actually move), if it is now
orthogonally adjacent to the player (i.e., next to the player directly above,
below, to the left, or to the right, but not diagonally), the player
suffers one blast of gas from that Tooter.  If this is the twelfth gas
blast the player has suffered during the game, the player passes out and
the game is over.
</p>
<p>
Your assignment is to complete <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/7/toot-skeleton.cpp">this C++
program skeleton</a> to produce a program that implements the described
behavior.  (We've indicated where you have work to do by comments containing
the text <code>TODO</code>; remove those comments as you finish each thing you
have to do.)  The program skeleton you are to flesh out defines four
classes that represent the four kinds of objects this program works with: 
Game, City, Tooter, and Player.  Details of the interface to these classes
are in the program skeleton, but here are the essential responsibilities
of each class:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><p>Game</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
To create a Game, you specify a number of rows and columns and the number
of Tooters to start with.  The Game object creates an appropriately sized
City and populates it with the Player and the Tooters.
</li><li>
A game may be played.  (Notice that the city is displayed after the Tooters
have had their turn to move, but not after the player has had its turn.)
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>City</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
When a City object of a particular size is created, it has no Tooters or
player.  In the City coordinate system, row 1, column 1 is the
upper-left-most position that can be occupied by a Tooter or Player.  (If
a City were created with 7 rows and 8 columns, then the lower-right-most
position that could be occupied would be row 7, column 8.)
</li><li>
You may tell a City object to create a Tooter at a particular position.
</li><li>
You may tell a City object to create a Player at a particular position.
</li><li>
You may tell a City object to have all the Tooters in it make their move.
</li><li>
You may tell a City object that the Tooters around the player are
being preached to.  Tooters that are converted must be removed from the
City, since they serve no further purpose in the game.
</li><li>
You may ask a City object if the player is at a particular position.
</li><li>
You may ask a City object its size, how many Tooters are at a particular
position, and how many Tooters altogether are in the City.
</li><li>
You may ask a City object whether moving from a particular position in a
particular direction is possible (i.e., would not go off the edge of the
city), and if so, what the resulting position would be.
</li><li>
You may ask a City object for access to its player.
</li><li>
A City object may be displayed on the screen, showing the locations of the
Tooters and player, along with other status information.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>Player</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
A Player is created at some position (using the City coordinate system, where
row 1, column 1 is the upper-left-most position, etc.).
</li><li>
You may tell a Player to move in a particular direction or to preach.
</li><li>
You may tell a Player it has suffered a gas blast.
</li><li>
You may ask a Player for its position, age (i.e., how many turns the player has
survived without passing out), and health status (i.e., how many more gas
blasts the player suffers will cause the player to pass out).
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><p>Tooter</p></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
A Tooter is created at some position (using the City coordinate system, where
row 1, column 1 is the upper-left-most position, etc.).
</li><li>
You may tell a Tooter to move.
</li><li>
You may ask a Tooter object for its position.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The skeleton program you are to complete has all of the class definitions and
implementations in one source file, which is awkward.  Since we haven't yet
learned about separate compilation involving classes, we'll have to live with
it.
</p>
<p>
Complete the implementation in accordance with the description of the game.
You are allowed to make whatever changes you want to the <em>private</em>
parts of the classes:  You may add or remove private data members or private
member functions, or change their types.  You must <strong>not</strong>
make any deletions, additions, or changes to the <em>public</em> interface
of any of these classes — we're depending on them staying the same
so that we can test your programs.  You can and will, of course, make
changes to the <em>implementations</em> of public member functions, since
the callers of the function wouldn't have to change any of the code they
write to call the function.  You must <strong>not</strong> declare any
public data members, nor use any global variables whose values may change
during execution (so global <em>constants</em> are OK).  You may add
additional functions that are not members of any class.  The word
<code>friend</code> must not appear in your program.
</p>
<p>
Any member functions you implement must never put an object into an
invalid state, one that will cause a problem later on.  (For example, bad
things could come from placing a Tooter outside the city.)  Any function
that has a reasonable way of indicating failure through its return value
should do so.  Constructors pose a special difficulty because they can't
return a value.  If a constructor can't do its job, we have it write an error
message and exit the program with failure by calling <code>exit(1);</code>.
(We haven't learned about throwing an exception to signal constructor failure.)
</p>
<p>
What you will turn in for this assignment is a zip file containing this
one file and nothing more:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
A text file named <strong>toot.cpp</strong> that contains the source code
for the completed C++ program.  This program must build successfully using
both g31 and either Visual C++ or clang++, and its correctness must not
depend on undefined program behavior.  Your program must not leak memory: 
Any object dynamically allocated during the execution of your program must
be deleted (once only, of course) by the time your main routine returns
normally.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Notice that you do not have to turn in a report describing the design of the
program and your test cases.  You also don't have to worry about writing
comments for your code, although you can for your own benefit; we're
grading this project only on correctness.
</p>
<p>
By Wednesday, December 6, there will be a link on the class web page that will
enable you to turn in your zip file electronically.  Turn in the file by
the due time above.
