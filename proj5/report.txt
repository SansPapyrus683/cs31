No notable obstacles.

Here's the pseudocode:

check if linLen is valid: if not, return 2

retCode = 0
lastPrinted = ""
for all read in words:
    if word is paragraph break
        if lastPrinted wasn't a newline:
            print a newline
            lastPrinted = "\n"
            currLen = 0
        
        continue

    for all word portions in word:
        if lastPrinted was a newline:
            print a newline

        calculate the number of spaces needed for lastPrinted
        if the spaces and word don't fit:
            print linLen length chunks of the string until the end
            if the current word portion's length > line length:
                retCode = 1
            set currLen to be the tail portion
        else:
            print them and go on

        update lastPrinted and currLen

if we last printed a character that wasn't a paragraph break
    print a newline to conclude

return retCode
