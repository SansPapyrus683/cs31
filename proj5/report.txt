No notable obstacles.

Here's the pseudocode:

check if linLen is valid: if not, return 2

lastWasPara = true
retCode = 0
for all read in words:
    if word is paragraph break
        if last output was not paragraph:
            output two newlines
            reset lastPrinted and currLen
        
        continue

    for all word portions in word:
        calculate the number of spaces needed for lastPrinted
        if the spaces and word don't fit:
            output linLen length chunks of the string until the end
            if the current word portion's length > line length:
                retCode = 1
        else:
            print them and go on

        update lastPrinted and currLen

if we outputted anything:
    print a newline to conclude

return retCode
