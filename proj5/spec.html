<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
Go through the following sections of the class zyBook, doing the
Participation Activities and Challenge Activities.  We will be looking at
whether you have ever successfully completed them; it does not matter how
many attempts you make before a successful completion (or how many
attempts you make after a successful completion if you want to experiment).
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<li>6.6 through 6.9</li>
<li>7.2 and 7.3 (Part 2 does not depend on these)</li>
<li>8.1 and 8.2 (Part 2 does not depend on these)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You should complete this part of the assignment well before the stated Part 1
due date, to give you ample time for Part 2.  
</p>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<h4>Phase 1: Learn how to read text from a file</h4>
<p>
Read the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/fileio.html">File I/O</a> writeup to learn how to work
with files.  Create a plain text file with a name of your choosing and put a
few lines of text in it.  Try running the last little program in the File I/O
writeup (the program with the <code>countLines</code> function), replacing the
file name <code>data.txt</code> with the name of your file.
</p><p>
In every past quarter that we've had projects that read from files, some
students have trouble getting their program to successfully open a file. 
This is usually because they did not specify a complete path name to the file
and did not understand what the File I/O writeup said about where the program
would look for the file.  Their problem was usually solved by their
specifying the complete pathname to the file (such as
<code>C:/CS31/P5/myfile.txt</code> on Windows or
<code>/Users/<em>yourUsername</em>/Desktop/myfile.txt</code> on a Mac).
</p><p>
You will not be turning in anything for this phase of the project, but you
should complete it as soon as possible to get past this potential stumbling
block.
</p>
<h4>Phase 2: Write a text renderer function</h4>
<p style="font-size: smaller">
Before you ask questions regarding this specification, see if your question
has already been addressed by the <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/5/faq.html">Project 5 FAQ</a>.  And
read the FAQ before you <!--a href="../../Submit/submission.cgi?asst=5"-->turn in
this project<!--/a-->, to be sure you didn't misinterpret anything.  Use the
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/Projects/5/tester.html">Project 5 Renderer</a> to test your understanding
of the rendering rules.
</p><p>
When a browser renders text onto a screen or in a window of a certain width,
or when a program like Microsoft Word formats text between margins of a
certain width, it tries to fit as many words in each line as it can.  For
this project, you will implement a function that renders text from a plain
text file into neatly arranged paragraphs with a particular maximum allowed
line length.  For example, if the desired maximum line length is 40
characters and the input text is
</p>
<pre>It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than
I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you;
I like work: it fascinates me.       I can sit and look at it for hours.
I love to keep     it by me: the idea of getting
rid
of it nearly breaks my heart. @P@ You cannot give me too
much work; to accumulate work has almost become


a passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly
an inch of room for any more.
</pre>
<p>
then the output text will be
</p>

doing more work than I should do.  It is

<em>from Jerome K. Jerome's
<a href="http://www.forgottenfutures.com/game/boat/boat.htm" target="_blank">Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)</a>.</em>
</p><p>
You are to implement the following function, whose job it is to do the
rendering:
</p>
<pre>	int render(int lineLength, istream&amp; inf, ostream&amp; outf);
</pre>
<p>
You may name the parameters something else, but there must be three parameters
of the indicated types in the indicated order.  (The
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/fileio.html">File I/O</a> tutorial explains
<code>istream</code> and <code>ostream</code>.)  The parameters are
</p>
<ul>
<li>
an int with the desired maximum line length
</li>
<li>
an already-opened input source you will read from (probably a file the
caller opened).
</li>
<li>
an already-opened output destination you will write to (probably either
<code>cout</code> or an output file the caller created)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The function must return an int with one of the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0 if is successful (i.e., neither of the following problems occurs)</li>
<li>1 if any input word portion (defined below) is longer than the maximum
line length</li>
<li>2 if the desired maximum line length is less than 1</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the case of the error situation that would cause the function to return
2, it must return 2 without writing any output.
</p><p>
Your <code>render</code> function may, of course, call other functions
you write to help it do its job.  You can test your <code>render</code>
function by calling it from a main routine of your choosing.  Our grading tool
will ignore your main routine by renaming it to something harmless.  If you
wish, your main routine could prompt the user for the file names and the line
length.  Alternatively, it could hardcode the names of the files to use and
prompt for only a line length.  Do whatever works best for you to help you
test your function.  Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>    int main()
    {
        const int MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH = 100;
        for (;;)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Enter input file name (or q to quit): ";
            char filename[MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH];
            cin.getline(filename, MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH);
            if (strcmp(filename, "q") == 0)
                break;
            ifstream infile(filename);
            if (!infile)
            {
                cerr &lt;&lt; "Cannot open " &lt;&lt; filename &lt;&lt; "!" &lt;&lt; endl;
                continue;
            }
            cout &lt;&lt; "Enter maximum line length: ";
            int len;
            cin &gt;&gt; len;
            cin.ignore(10000, '\n');
            int returnCode = render(len, infile, cout);
            cout &lt;&lt; "Return code is " &lt;&lt; returnCode &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
We use the following definitions in the rendering rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A <em>word</em> is a sequence of non-whitespace characters not immediately
preceded or followed by a non-whitespace character.  (The &lt;cctype&gt;
function <code>isspace</code> tells you if a character is a whitespace
character.)  The string <code>"swan's nest"</code> contains two words,
<code>swan's</code> and <code>nest</code>.  Because of immediately preceding
or following non-whitespace, <code>swan</code>, <code>wa</code>,
<code>'s</code>, and <code>nes</code> are not words of that string.
</li>
<li>
A word can be viewed as a sequence of one or more <em>word portions</em>.
The first word portion in a word starts at the start of the word; subsequent
word portions in a word start just after the last character of the previous
word portion.  The last character of a word portion is the first hyphen at or
after the start of that word portion, or the end of the word if there is no
hyphen after the start of that word portion.  Here are examples, including
some pathological ones:
<pre>	<em>Word</em>                <em>Word portions</em>
	Thames              Thames
	so-called           so- <em>and</em> called
	Henley-on-Thames    Henley-<em>,</em> on-<em>,</em> <em>and</em> Thames
	so--called          so-<em>,</em> -<em>,</em> <em>and</em> called
	so-                 so-
	-so                 -<em>,</em> <em> and </em> so
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are the rendering rules:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Fit as many word portions in an output line as you can without exceeding
the line length.  Output lines may well end up being different lengths,
giving a "ragged-right" effect; your renderer will not try to right-justify
the text.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Words in an output line must normally be separated by one blank.  However,
if the last character of an output word is a period, question mark,
exclamation point, or colon, it must be separated from any following word on
that output line by two blanks.  The last word on an output line must not be
followed by any blanks.  The first word portion on an output line must not be
preceded by any blanks.  Blanks must not appear on an output line within any
word.  The last line of output must end with a newline, and there must be no
output lines (not even empty ones) after the last word of the last
paragraph.  For example, if the last word in the input is
<code>bye</code>, then the last four characters your function would write
are <code>'b'&nbsp;&nbsp;'y'&nbsp;&nbsp;'e'&nbsp;&nbsp;'\n'</code>.  That
does <em>not</em> produce an empty last line.  Writing this <em>would</em>
produce an empty last line, in violation of this rule:
<code>'b'&nbsp;&nbsp;'y'&nbsp;&nbsp;'e'&nbsp;&nbsp;'\n'&nbsp;&nbsp;'\n'</code>.
</p><p>
Notice that this rule implies that if a word containing a hyphen is broken at
a hyphen to fit on an output line, the hyphen must be the last character of
one output line, and the character after the hyphen must be the first
character of the next output line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a word portion is longer than the line length, as much as will fit must be
on an output line by itself.  The rest of that word portion must begin the
next output line (and, of course, is subject to similar splitting if it's too
long).  If this situation ever occurs, your function continues rendering, but
it must eventually return 1 instead of 0 to its caller.  Notice that this is
the only situation where a word is allowed to be split across lines other than
at a hyphen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The input word <code>@P@</code> is not to be processed as a word according
to the above rules; instead, it indicates a paragraph break.  The first
word in the input following a paragraph break will be the first word of a
new paragraph in the output.  If a paragraph has already been output, the
new paragraph must be separated from the one that precedes it by an empty
line (i.e., a line with no characters other than the terminating newline).
The very first output paragraph must not be preceded by an empty line.
The very last output paragraph must not be followed by an empty line.
Two or more consecutive <code>@P@</code> words in the input are treated as
just one paragraph break.  Notice that <code>banjo@P@</code> is one
eight-character word; it does not cause a paragraph break, because in that
string, <code>@P@</code> is not a word because of the immediately preceding
non-whitespace character <code>o</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Notice that these rules imply that if the line length is valid but the
input contains no words, <code>render</code> must return 0 without writing
any output whatsoever.
</p><p>
Your <code>render</code> function and any functions you write that it
calls directly or indirectly <strong>must not</strong> use any std::string
objects.  If you need to use a string, use a C string.  Your function may
assume that no input line will be 180 or more characters long (i.e., we
will not test it with input lines that long).
</p><p>
This project is doable without assuming any upper limit for the output
line length (the first parameter of <code>render</code>) � rather
than storing the parts of an output line in a C string to be written
later, you instead write them as soon as you can.  However, some people
may not figure out how to do that, so we'll give you a choice.  If the first
parameter of <code>render</code> is greater than 250, your implementation
of <code>render</code> must either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
return 2 without writing any output; or
</li><li>
render the text using the indicated line length, returning 0 or 1 as
appropriate (i.e., your algorithm doesn't impose any upper limit on the output
line length).  Implementing this choice correctly (instead of returning 2 and
producing no output) is worth 5 bonus points.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Although the program you turn in must not use any C++ strings, only C strings,
you might want to consider this development strategy:  Ignore this restriction
at first, and develop a working solution that uses C++ strings.  After you've
ironed out the issues in writing the renderer, save a backup, and then
convert your using C++ strings to using C strings instead.  This approach
helps you avoid confusing the mistakes in your use of C strings with the
mistakes in your rendering algorithm, so might make debugging easier.)
</p><p>
Your <code>render</code> function and any functions you write that it
calls directly or indirectly must not read from any source other than the
<code>istream</code> passed as the second parameter and must not write to
any destination other than the <code>ostream</code> passed as the third
parameter, except that you may write anything you want to <code>cerr</code>.
Our grading tool will discard anything written to <code>cerr</code>, so feel
free to use it for debugging purposes.
</p><p>
Your program must not use any global variables whose values may be changed
during execution.  Global <em>constants</em> are OK.
</p><p>
The program you turn in must build successfully under both g31 and either
Visual C++ or clang++, and its correctness must not depend on undefined
program behavior.  Your program could not, for example, assume anything
about s's value in the following, or even whether or not the program crashes: 
</p>
<pre>	void f()
	{
	    char s[6];
	    strcpy(s, "Thames");  // s is too short for 6+1 chars
	    �
</pre>
<h3>What to turn in</h3>
<p>
You won't turn anything in through the CS 31 web site for Part 1; the zyBook
system notes your successful completion of the PAs and CAs. For Part 2, turn
in a zip file containing these two files and nothing more: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
A text file named <strong>render.cpp</strong> that contains the source
code for your C++ program.  Your source code should have helpful comments
that tell the purpose of the major segments of your function and explain any
non-obvious code.
</p><p>
Try to ensure that your program does something that meets the spec for at
least a few test cases.  That way, you can get some partial credit for a
program that does not meet the entire specification.
</p>
</li>
<li>A file named <strong>report.docx</strong> (in Microsoft Word format), or
<strong>report.txt</strong> (an ordinary text file) that contains:
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
<li>
A brief description of notable obstacles you overcame.
</li>
<li>
A description of the design of your project.  Use
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall23/cs31/pseudocode.html">pseudocode</a> where it clarifies
the presentation.  Someone reading your description should be able to
determine what the responsibilities of the functions you wrote are.  If
someone had to modify your code later, could they from your description
readily find in your program the approximate location of the code that, for
example, handles a word portion not fitting on a line?
</li>
<li>
A list of the test data that could be used to thoroughly test
your function, along with the reason for each test case (e.g. "word broken at
hyphen" or "two spaces after period").  You must note which test cases
your program does not handle correctly. (This could happen if you didn't
have time to write a complete solution, or if you ran out of time while
still debugging a supposedly complete solution.)
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
By November 19, there will be links on the class webpage that will enable you
to turn in your zip file electronically.  Turn in the file by the due time
above.
</p>
<h3>Notes for Visual C++ users</h3>
<p>
Microsoft made a controversial decision to issue by default an error or
warning when your code uses certain functions from the standard C and C++
libraries (e.g., <code>strcpy</code>).  These warnings call those
functions unsafe and recommend using different functions in their place;
those other functions, though, are not Standard C++ functions, so will
cause a compilation failure when you try to build your program under
clang++ g++.  Therefore, for this class, we want to use functions like
<code>strcpy</code> without getting those warnings from Visual C++; to
eliminate them, put the following line in your program <em>before</em> any
of your <code>#include</code>s:
</p>
<pre>	#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
</pre>
<p>
It is OK and harmless to leave that line in when you build your program
using g31 or clang++ and when you turn it in.
</p><p>
If you declare a large array in a function, Visual C++ gives a harmless
warning <code>C6262: Function uses '<em>NNNNN</em>' bytes of stack:
exceeds /analyze:stacksize '16384'. Consider moving some data to the
heap.</code>, where <em>NNNNN</em> is some number.  You can eliminate that
warning by putting the following line in your program above the
<code>#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE</code>:
</p>
<pre>        #pragma warning(disable:6262)
</pre>
<p>
It is OK and harmless to leave that line in when you build your program
using g31 or clang++ and when you turn it in, even if you get a warning
about the pragma being ignored.
</p><p>
Alternatively, in Visual Studio, select Project / <em>yourProjectName</em>
properties, then select Configuration Properties / Code Analysis / General,
and then in Code Analysis's stacksize, modify 16384 to, say, 100000.
</p><p>
If your program dies under Visual C++ with a dialog box appearing saying
"Debug Assertion Failed! ... File: ...\src\isctype.c ...  expression:
(unsigned)(c+1)&lt;=256", then you called one of the functions defined by
<code>&lt;cctype&gt;</code>, such as <code>isspace</code>, with a character
whose encoding is outside the range of 0 through 127.  Since all the
normal characters you would use (space, letters, punctuation,
<code>'\0'</code>, etc.) fall in that range, you're probably passing an
uninitialized character to the function.  Perhaps you're examining a
character past the <code>'\0'</code> marking the end of a C string, or
perhaps you built what you thought was a C string but forgot to end it
with a <code>'\0'</code>.
