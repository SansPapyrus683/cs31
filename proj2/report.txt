The main difficulty I had working on this project was understanding the specs.
Besides that, there weren't any real troubles I had.

TEST CASES:
("place name", 200, "florida") is a quick sanity check to see if the program generally works and outputs the special rate for Florida.
("bruh", 1, "moment") does the same thing.
("another place name", 200, "FloridA") checks if only lowercase location names works.
("never gonna", 200, "New York") checks the same thing as well as if the program reads multi-word inputs properly.
("", 10, "give you up") checks if the correct error message for invalid property names is printed.
("never gonna", 0, "let you down") checks if the correct error message for invalid overestimates is printed.
("never gonna", -100.12, "run around") does the same thing but for negative overestimates
("and desert you", 100, "") checks if the correct error message for invalid location names is printed.
("", 50, "") checks that the program only outputs one error message when given multiple invalid inputs.
("amogus", -1, "") does the same thing.
