<h2>Project 2 Test Data</h2>
<p>
For Project 2, you not only had to compute the right fine for a variety of
cases, but you had to report errors correctly.  The fine should agree with
what the <a href="calc.html">financial fraud calculator</a> computes, and the
output had to be formatted <em>exactly</em> as the spec required.
</p>
<p>
There were 27 test cases.  The first six cases were worth 4 points each, cases
7 through 22 were worth 3 points each, cases 23 through 25 were worth 2 points
each, and the last two were worth 1 point each.
